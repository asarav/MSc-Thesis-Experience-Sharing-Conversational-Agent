     "Trying to stick to a diet filled with foods you genuinely dislike is setting you up for disaster. Kale might be a superfood, but if you can't stand it then don't eat it! Instead, build your diet based on the foods you enjoy- you'll find it much, much easier to sustain."],
    ["How do you record what you eat?",
     "It helps to write things down in a food journal and remind yourself frequently so that you do not forget. Start by tracking when, what and how much you eat and drink each day. Your food journal will be more accurate when you record your food and drinks right after eating. The best way to know how much you are eating is to measure your food and beverage portions."],
    ["Why am I so hungry?",
     "If you are removing food items from your diet, you will obviously be less full. Hunger is the bodyâ€™s way of telling a person that it needs food. After eating enough food, hunger usually temporarily goes away. Hunger starts with a hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin typically comes in waves, so if you are feeling hungry and manage to wait it out, you will feel less hungry afterwards. Of course, make sure that your dietary reductions are within reason."],

     "The only way a diet is successful is by sustaining it. What is most important is to stay consistant and to make it a habit. You have to be focused and be committed to make the appropriate changes."]
