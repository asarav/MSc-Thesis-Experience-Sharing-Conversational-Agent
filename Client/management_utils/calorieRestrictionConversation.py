    ["How is the goal calculated?",
     "The goal is calculated by finding a value that is about 5 to 10% less than the current caloric consumption. We also check to make sure that the caloric consumption is above a certain threshold to avoid any drastic reductions in calories that could result in starvation or negative health effects."],
    ["How was my final caloric intake goal calculated?",
     "The goal is calculated by finding a value that is about 5 to 10% less than the current caloric consumption. We also check to make sure that the caloric consumption is above a certain threshold to avoid any drastic reductions in calories that could result in starvation or negative health effects."],
    ["How was the intermediate milestone calculated?",
    "The milestone was calculated by determining the difference between your current caloric intake and the final goal. Then, the halfway point was calculated."],
    ["Why was an intermediate milestone calculated?",
    "The point of the intermediate milestone is to ensure that you can reach your final goal in a manageable way by working towards it over time. It also encourages consistency and the building of a daily habit"],
    ["What is 'Calorie Restriction'?",
    "Caloric restriction comes in many forms such as fasting certain days of the week, or eating smaller portions or choosing foods with fewer calories. In the case of this type of goal which is about daily caloric intake, portion control, or choosing healthier foods is more appropriate."],
    ["How can I cut or reduce calories",
     "There are a number of ways to do this. Since you will be measuring your calories, you will already be taking the first few steps.\n" +
     "Use less sauce. Adding ketchup or mayonnaise to your food can add more calories than you may realize. In fact, only 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of mayonnaise adds an extra 57 calories to your meal.\n" +
     "Don’t drink your calories. Drinks can be a forgotten source of calories in your diet.\n " +
     "Sugar-sweetened drinks, such as soda, are also linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n " +
     "A single 16-ounce (475-ml) bottle of Coke packs nearly 200 calories and 44 grams of sugar.\n " +
     "One study suggests that drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages not only adds many unnecessary calories to your diet but may also increase your hunger later on.\n " +
     "You may want to cut back on other high-sugar, high-calorie drinks as well. These include alcohol, some commercially produced coffee drinks, and sugar-sweetened fruit juices and smoothies.\n " +
     "Don’t add sugar to tea and coffee. Tea and coffee are healthy, low-calorie drinks, but spooning in just 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of sugar adds around 16 calories to your drink. Though this may not sound like much, the calories in a few cups or glasses of sugar-sweetened tea a day can add up."],

    ["How will calorie reduction affect my weight or obesity?",
    "Studies show that calorie restriction is more effective for obesity treatment than dietary fat restriction. It is a simple fact that if you are eating fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. On the other hand, if you eat more than you burn, then you will gain weight."],
    ["What does it mean to be overweight or obese?",
     "Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese."],

    ["Is fruit bad for me because it contains sugar?",
    "Sugar gets such a bad rap in the popular press that some people hesitate to eat foods that contain natural sugars, especially fruit. There’s plenty of research exposing the detrimental health effects of eating too much added sugar, but less so with natural sugars. Overall, fruit intake is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. Fruits contain natural sugar and many other beneficial nutrients, so they can be a more healthful addition to a daily diet than more processed foods."],
    ["Are canned and frozen fruits and vegetables lower in nutrients?",
    "Unless fruits and vegetables are eaten immediately after harvesting, there is going to be nutrient loss to some degree. Regardless of losses, fruits and vegetables remain a valuable source of a variety of nutrients. In certain cases, frozen or canned produce may contain higher levels of nutrients than fresh produce that has been stored for too long. To obtain the most nutrients, consume fresh produce within a few days, or frozen varieties within a few weeks. When choosing canned or frozen produce, select options that do not include extra sodium, sugar, or other additives."],
    ["Are smoothies and juices just as good as eating whole fruits and vegetables?",
    "Whole fruits and vegetables are the best choice. Smoothies that blend whole fruits and vegetables without additional sweeteners and are served in appropriate portions may be helpful for some people to consume more of these foods, but should not replace eating them in their whole form. It is best to prepare smoothies at home so that you can control the type and amount of ingredients added to ensure calorie control and optimal nutrients.  Juices are easy to over-consume and, especially if weight control is a concern, should be limited to one small glass per day."],
    ["How many calories do you need?",
     "The number of calories you need depends on your age, body size, and activity levels—most teens and adults need somewhere around 1,500 to 2,500 calories per day. The bigger you are, the more calories you need to maintain that weight. If you want to gain weight, you'll need to take in more calories, and if you want to lose weight, you'll need to consume few calories or burn more."],
    ["What's the best way to track or count calories?",
    "You can use a notebook or a paper food diary, look up the calorie counts and do the calculations. But these days, the best way is to use a calorie tracking website that can help you track calories, such as myfitnesspal. You pick out the foods you eat, the beverages you drink, and the site will count the calories and give you a daily nutrition grade. Also, you can track the calories your body burns every day. And it's free."],
    ["How can I determine caloric intake?",
     "You can determine caloric intake by looking at nutrition labels on food packaging to determine how many calories you are consuming."],
    ["Bananas",
     "Bananas contains about 12 grams of sugar and 89 calories per 100 grams."],
    ["Apples",
     "Apples contain about 10 grams of sugar and 52 calories per 100 grams."],
    ["Cookies",
     "There are different types of cookies, and based on the type, the nutrition can vary. Generally, they are classified as deserts or sweets which means that the consumption of cookies is not advised for improving your diet."],
    ["Range of calories? Healthy calories? Normal calories?",
     "Typically, a healthy range for caloric intake will depend on your level of activity, gender, and age, but a minimum of 1200 calories is required to stay healthy, and an upper limit of 3000 when you are active. 2000 calories tend to be typical."],
    ["Range of sugar? Healthy sugar? Normal sugar?",
     "Typically, a healthy range for sugar intake will depend on your level of activity, gender, and age, but a maximum of 37.5 grams of sugar for men and 25 grams for women is recommended. With regards to a minimum, there is no recommended minimum for added sugars."],
    ["What is a calorie?",
    "A calorie is a unit of energy. Historically, scientists have defined 'calorie' to mean a unit of energy or heat that could come from a variety of sources, such as coal or gas. In a nutritional sense, all types of food — whether they are fats, proteins, carbohydrates or sugars — are important sources of calories, which people need to live and function."]
