    ["How is the goal calculated?",
     "The goal is calculated by finding a value that is about 5 to 10% less than the current caloric consumption. We also check to make sure that the caloric consumption is above a certain threshold to avoid any drastic reductions in calories that could result in starvation or negative health effects."],
    ["How was my final caloric intake goal calculated?",
     "The goal is calculated by finding a value that is about 5 to 10% less than the current caloric consumption. We also check to make sure that the caloric consumption is above a certain threshold to avoid any drastic reductions in calories that could result in starvation or negative health effects."],
    ["How was the intermediate milestone calculated?",
    "The milestone was calculated by determining the difference between your current caloric intake and the final goal. Then, the halfway point was calculated."],
    ["Why was an intermediate milestone calculated?",
    "The point of the intermediate milestone is to ensure that you can reach your final goal in a manageable way by working towards it over time. It also encourages consistency and the building of a daily habit"],
    ["What is 'Calorie Restriction'?",
    "Caloric restriction comes in many forms such as fasting certain days of the week, or eating smaller portions or choosing foods with fewer calories. In the case of this type of goal which is about daily caloric intake, portion control, or choosing healthier foods is more appropriate."],
    ["How can I cut or reduce calories",
     "There are a number of ways to do this. Since you will be measuring your calories, you will already be taking the first few steps.\n" +
     "Use less sauce. Adding ketchup or mayonnaise to your food can add more calories than you may realize. In fact, only 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of mayonnaise adds an extra 57 calories to your meal.\n" +
     "Don’t drink your calories. Drinks can be a forgotten source of calories in your diet.\n " +
     "Sugar-sweetened drinks, such as soda, are also linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n " +
     "A single 16-ounce (475-ml) bottle of Coke packs nearly 200 calories and 44 grams of sugar.\n " +
     "One study suggests that drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages not only adds many unnecessary calories to your diet but may also increase your hunger later on.\n " +
     "You may want to cut back on other high-sugar, high-calorie drinks as well. These include alcohol, some commercially produced coffee drinks, and sugar-sweetened fruit juices and smoothies.\n " +
     "Don’t add sugar to tea and coffee. Tea and coffee are healthy, low-calorie drinks, but spooning in just 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of sugar adds around 16 calories to your drink. Though this may not sound like much, the calories in a few cups or glasses of sugar-sweetened tea a day can add up."],

    ["How will calorie reduction affect my weight or obesity?",
